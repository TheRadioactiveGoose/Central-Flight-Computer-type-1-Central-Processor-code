# Central-Flight-Computer-type-1-Central-Processor-code
this code is a compilation of a series of custom, local libraries, downloaded public libraries, and a main source code file that constitute the code that will run on my first flight computer onboard a model rocket, with the project beginning in november of 2025. in mid-late february of 2026, i created my first Github repository to hold this project, where it is now. this code will do a series of things. first, it communicates with a groundstation via radio telemetry. with this, it will both send and recieve data/information, pertaining to it's navigational data, it's status, and commands from ground. it will also keep track of it's navigational data, and process it with a Kalman filter, which will ensure accuracy and reduce noise across the sensor suite. it will also control the other components of this rocket, including the onboard Flight Guidance Computer, which will run computations to guide the rocket, and control other components such as a downlinking camera and other onboard systems, such as EECOM (environmental, electrical, internal communications).
